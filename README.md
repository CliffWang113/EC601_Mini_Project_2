# EC601_Mini_Project_2
This project is implemented for Boston University, EC601 Mini Project #2. The goal of this Mini Porject is to train a simple machine learning model to recognize two categories.

## Training Dataset & Testing Dataset

- I trained this model to recognize the beloning of an art work: Van Gogh or Claude Monet.
- The training dataset includes 897 Van Gogh's paints and 975 Claude Monet's paints.
- The testing dataset includes 200 paints (100 for Van Gogh and 100 for Monet).
- Here are two Sample paints:
	- Van Gogh

	- Claude Monet

## Results
